<h1>EmbeddedProjectApi</h1>

EmbeddedProjectApi is a backend API designed for embedded systems integration, providing robust functionalities to manage, control, and communicate with hardware components.

<h1>Features</h1>

API for Embedded Systems: Supports communication with embedded devices, such as Arduino or other microcontrollers.

Modular Design: Easy to extend and adapt to specific hardware requirements.

Built with .NET Core: Leveraging the power of ASP.NET Core for performance and scalability.

Database Support: Integrated with SQL Server for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Simulation Ready: Compatible with tools like Tinkercad for prototyping and testing.


Tech Stack

Backend: ASP.NET Core 8

Database: SQL Server

Programming Language: C#

Hardware Integration: Arduino Uno, Breadboard, DC Motor


Getting Started

Prerequisites

1. .NET SDK (Version 8.0 or later)


2. SQL Server installed locally or on a cloud service.


3. Arduino IDE and hardware (optional for testing with real devices).



Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/EmbeddedProjectApi.git  
cd EmbeddedProjectApi


2. Set up the database:

Update the connection string in appsettings.json.

Run the migration commands:

dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate  
dotnet ef database update



3. Run the API:

dotnet run


4. Test the API using tools like Postman or Swagger UI.



Usage

Endpoints:

GET /api/devices - Retrieve a list of devices.

POST /api/devices - Add a new device.

PUT /api/devices/{id} - Update an existing device.

DELETE /api/devices/{id} - Delete a device.


Hardware Simulation:
Use Tinkercad to simulate the embedded system and test API integration.
